# Discord-Assign-Badges-in-client
You can put any badge you want on your profile using the console within the Discord client.

Open the .txt file and copy everything inside. Then, open the console in your Discord client or Discord web, and type 'allow pasting' into the console menu. This will grant you access to paste what you've copied. After that, copy and paste everything from the .txt file and press enter. All badges will then appear on your profile. If they don't appear, type 'assignBadges()' into the console menu. You can type 'assignBadges()' into the console every time badges disappear.

For those who don't know how to open the console in the client, simply press 'CTRL + SHIFT + I' keys.
